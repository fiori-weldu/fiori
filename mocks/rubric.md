# Mock Interview Grading Rubric

This rubric is designed to evaluate answers during mock interviews on a scale from 0–10, with additional penalties applied for communication or confidence issues. It also outlines time guidelines for short, medium, and scenario-based questions.

---

## 1. Base Score (0–10)

Use this section to assess the correctness, completeness, and relevance of the candidate’s answer. The base score should be decided **before** applying any penalties or bonuses.

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **10**    | **Exceptionally correct and comprehensive**: The answer is 100% correct, fully exhaustive, and provides an insight or perspective new to the interviewer.                            |
| **9**     | **Fully correct and comprehensive**: The answer is 100% correct and fully exhaustive (covers all key points with no omissions), but does not necessarily introduce new insights.     |
| **8**     | **Correct and mostly comprehensive**: The answer is correct but with a **few minor relevant omissions**. Overall demonstrates thorough understanding but misses small details.       |
| **7**     | **Mostly correct**: The answer is substantially correct but with **multiple relevant omissions** or gaps in reasoning. The main idea is there, but some completeness is lacking.     |
| **6**     | **Slightly above baseline**: The answer is **more correct than not**, addressing the core of the question but **only scratching the surface**. Key details or depth are missing.     |
| **5**     | **Correct deflection**: The candidate cannot directly answer the main question but **correctly addresses a related/similar** question, showing some domain knowledge.                |
| **4**     | **Mostly correct deflection**: The candidate deflects to a related question but only **partially** answers correctly. Some relevant ideas are present, but confusion or gaps remain. |
| **3**     | **Vague familiarity**: The candidate shows **minimal understanding** of the topic. The response contains correct terms or concepts but lacks coherence or depth.                     |
| **2**     | **Distantly related**: The candidate provides content that is **tangentially related** to the question’s domain but does not address the core.                                       |
| **1**     | **Unrelated**: The candidate’s response is clearly **off-topic** and does not demonstrate meaningful knowledge of the subject.                                                       |
| **0**     | **No attempt / Pass**: The candidate explicitly passes or offers **no answer** to the question.                                                                                      |

### Notes on “Exhaustive” and “Omissions”
- **Exhaustive**: The candidate explains the **key concepts**, **relevant nuances**, and **common pitfalls** comprehensively.  
- **Relevant Omissions**: Important details that would be expected in a thorough answer are missing—this could be steps in a process, crucial definitions, or specific considerations.

## 2. Additional Penalties (Apply After Base Score)

These penalties account for communication issues, confidence, or intervention needed. Each penalty can be applied **once or multiple times** (unless otherwise specified). Consider capping penalties so final scores cannot go below zero, or clarify if negative scores are simply reported as 0.

| **Code**         |  **Penalty** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | -----------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TS / TL**      |           -2 | **Too Short / Too Long**: The candidate either took **less than half** or **more than twice** the recommended duration for the question. <br><br>**Time Guidelines**: <ul><li>Short question: ~30 sec</li><li>Medium question: ~90 sec</li><li>Scenario-based question: ~180 sec</li></ul> If the candidate uses significantly less or more than 2× the recommended time, penalize. |
| **TV**           |           -2 | **Too Vague**: The response lacks clarity, is confusing, or does not directly address the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **NC**           |           -2 | **Not Confident**: The candidate’s delivery indicates significant uncertainty (excessive disclaimers, repeated self-doubt, or hesitant communication).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **RQ**           |           -1 | **Repeat/Rephrase Question**: The interviewer had to repeat or significantly rephrase the question due to the candidate’s lack of focus or understanding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **H / HH / HHH** | -1 / -2 / -3 | **Hints**: The interviewer provided hints to keep the candidate on track. <br> - **H (-1)**: Minor nudge <br> - **HH (-2)**: Multiple clarifications <br> - **HHH (-3)**: Significant guidance was required                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **I**            |           -1 | **Interruption**: The candidate **interrupts the interviewer** inappropriately. (If the interviewer interrupts the candidate, count it as a hint, not as an interruption.)                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Applying Penalties

1. **Calculate Base Score** from the 0–10 scale.  
2. **Deduct Penalties** based on codes that apply.  
3. **Final Score** = Base Score – (Sum of Applicable Penalties).

---

## 3. Optional Bonus (If Desired)

You could introduce **+1** in certain exceptional situations, such as:
- Outstanding communication (clear, concise, and engaging).
- Exceptionally creative or innovative approach.

If you apply a bonus, add it after penalties. You may choose to cap the final score at 10 to maintain consistency.

---

## 4. Optional Secondary Criteria (Qualitative Feedback)

In addition to the numeric score, you may record separate qualitative assessments:

1. **Communication & Clarity** (1–5): How well the candidate structures the answer, uses terminology, and conveys ideas.  
2. **Problem-Solving Approach** (1–5): How logically or systematically the candidate approaches the question.  
3. **Depth of Knowledge** (1–5): How deeply the candidate understands underlying principles or can handle follow-up questions.  
4. **Time Management** (1–5): How effectively the candidate uses the recommended time.

These do not directly affect the 0–10 score unless you choose to factor them in.

## 5. Example of Final Scoring

1. **Assign Base Score (0–10)**  
   - Example: The candidate’s answer is “Mostly correct with multiple omissions” ⇒ **7**.

2. **Apply Penalties**  
   - Suppose the candidate went significantly over double the recommended time for a short question ⇒ **TL penalty (-2)**.  
   - Also required one minor hint ⇒ **H penalty (-1)**.  
   - Total penalties = -3.

3. **Calculate Final Score**  
   - Base (7) – 3 (penalties) = **4**.

4. **Optional Bonus**  
   - If no bonus applies, the final is simply **4**.

---

## 6. Implementation Tips

1. **Clarify Penalty Thresholds**  
   - Ensure everyone understands the recommended time frames and how to judge “too short” or “too long.”  
   - Provide examples of what constitutes “too vague,” “lack of confidence,” or a “minor” versus “significant” hint.

2. **Discuss and Calibrate**  
   - If multiple evaluators use this rubric, run calibration sessions with sample answers to ensure consistent scoring.

3. **Keep Records**  
   - Document each candidate’s final score, the penalties/bonuses applied, and any secondary criteria ratings. This helps with transparency and feedback.
