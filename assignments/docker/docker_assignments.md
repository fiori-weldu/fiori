|             | 1 | Dockerize a web-application implemented in a compiled programming language (.Net, Java, Node.js, etc). Build an image on your local machine. |
|             | 2 | Run the image on your local machine make sure that the application is operational from within the container. |
|             | 3 | Run some commands from within the container (create some files, edit them, run some utility commands, etc.) |
|             | 4 | Stop the container. Re-start the container. Delete the container. Re-start new container. Notice that manipulations from Step 3 are gone. |
|             | 5 | Attach a Persistent Volume to the container. Runs some commands inside the container to create files on the persistent volume. Delete the container (but not the volume), create new container, with the old volume, demonstrate that the old files on the volume are still available. |
|             | 6 | Use bind mount to sync the contents of a folder outside the container with a folder inside the container. |
|             | 7 | Utilize port-forwarding options to launch multiple containers on the same machine. |
|             | 8 | (Re-)Tag the image with custom image tag. |
|             | 9 | Push the image to a remote container registry. |
|             | 10 | Practice other useful docker commands (docker logs, docker images, docker ps, docker rmi, docker volume ls). |
|             | 11 | (Bonus) Build a multi-stage docker image. |
|             | 12 | (Bonus) Pull the container from a remote container registry onto a different machine and run it. |
|             | 13 | (Bonus) Demonstrate the usage of docker-compose to orchestrate the launch of multiple docker containers at once. |
